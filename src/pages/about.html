                <p>This interactive visualization complements the physicalization; it captures my journey throughout the
                    year—before, during, and after the crisis. It also highlights some milestones and the first time I
                    did certain things.</p>

                <p>It all began with a painful breakup that triggered a mental health crisis, one that had been quietly
                    building up for years. The accumulation of anxiety and unprocessed emotions finally caught up with
                    me. Healing from that experience turned out to be a deeply transformative journey, one I’ve chosen
                    to share through this project. </p>
                <p> As I was having a hard time trying to heal from the weirdest breakup in my life and being close to
                    divorce. I wanted to make something meaningful with the experience, something that let me explore
                    the nuances of healing and learning how to become mentally and spiritually stronger.</p>

                <h2>I used my own experience as a way to reflect on universal issues like breakups, the fragility of our
                    mental health, marriage, dating, and the complexities of relationships.</h2>

                <h3>Creation as a healing tool</h3>
                <p>Every working session for this project started with a lot of self doubt: Is this worth it?, Will
                    anyone care?, Is this just a stupid idea? and ended in satisfaction, I discovered how much I enjoy
                    creating and that kept me going every time.</p>
                <p>The project took almost one year of work in between my 9 to 6, it was challenging but it teach me the
                    value of patience with myself and with the outcome, I had to keep working—even when I was tired of
                    it. This project wasn’t about likes or reactions—it was about healing, growth, and trusting myself,
                    trusting the process and the healing power of craft and creativity.</p>

                <h3>The gift of life</h3>
                <p>During the making of this project I came to understand something essential: the joy we feel today
                    might become the sorrow of tomorrow, likewise, today’s pain and sadness can turn into tomorrow’s
                    peace and happiness. </p>
                <p>Everything is changing all the time, inside and outside our personal sphere, nothing is permanent,
                    not joy and not pain, I learned to see every day as a gift that I will never get back—regardless of
                    whether it was filled with joy, sadness, confusion, or chaos. In the end it adds to the rich and
                    wonderful and rare experience of being alive. </p>
