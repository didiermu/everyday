                <p>This section is for those who struggle as I did. I wanted to share some of the lessons learned and
                    the tools that helped me in the same way many content creators out there helped me during the worst
                    moments of the crisis.</p>
                <p>All the articles, posts and blog entries, books, podcasts, videos, interviews that were like candles
                    in the darkness and warm hugs during the painful days and nights. I hope you find something that
                    resonates or make sense to you and help you in your own journey.</p>

                <h4>Meditation</h4>
                <span>Tool 3/4_____ 4 min.</span>
                <p>I’ve been following Buddhist teachings for years, but over time, my practice became inconsistent.
                    That inconsistency left me vulnerable—emotionally unsteady and unable to regulate my inner world.
                    The result was deep suffering, not just for me, but for those closest to me.</p>

            <div class="container panels__large">
                <p> But something changed during this crisis. I stopped blaming others or external circumstances for my
                    pain. I decided to take full responsibility—to learn from my mistakes, to return to meditation with
                    the same effort I put into my physical health. I’m still learning, but after more than a year of
                    committed and disciplined effort, I’m staring to see some progress and you will see it too, I
                    promise, because when you practice being in the present moment and nothing else, things change,
                    anxiety decreases and each day you become more aware of your tendency to overthink, to find your way
                    into suffering telling yourself the same stories again and again. </p>

                <p>Meditation is not hard, but it’s hard to dare to do absolutely nothing for at least 30 minutes a day
                    in a world that demands productivity and many other things from us. Meditation helps us to live with
                    intention and it also helps us to become stronger and better equipped to face hard moments of our
                    lives and things in a world that we can’t control.</p>

                <h4>Healing from a breakup</h4>
                <span>Lesson 3/4_____ 4 min.</span>
                <p>As Alain de Botton puts it in his book A Therapeutic Journey: “…it’s not really about the wrong
                    others have done to us; it’s an honest appraisal of the way we have let them do these things to us,
                    because we have been insufficiently on our own side.”</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container panels__large">
                <p> I discover that healing from a breakup it’s not about the one who hurt you, it’s about understanding
                    why did you ended up with the wrong person and or at the wrong time, in what ways were you
                    vulnerable in that particular time that you were unaware of, what kinds of threats and destructive
                    behaviors you’ve being carrying for so long, what were the narratives you keep telling to yourself
                    that can get in the way to find what you really need to be happy.</p>
                <p>It’s about realizing how little we know about ourselves, and others.</p>
                <h2>“…it’s not really about the wrong others have done to us; it’s an honest appraisal of the way we
                    have let them do these things to us, because we have been insufficiently on our own side.”</h2>
                <p>Healing from a breakup is about forgiving ourselves and the other person knowing that we both ended
                    up in this situation as a result of poor emotional skills and not loving ourselves enough before
                    trying to love someone else or get someone to love us.</p>
                <p>Scientist had shown how our brains change due to all the hormonal flood that happens when we “fall in
                    love”, but that stage is just the start in the journey of truly get to love someone, so it’s
                    important to distinguish love from dopamine craving and need of validation.</p>
